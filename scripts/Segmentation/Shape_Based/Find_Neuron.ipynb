    "This pipeline is designed to import immunofluorescence images of axonal components of nerves within 2D samples, process the image with rolling-ball background subtraction of radius R = 5 pixels, a 99.99th percentile renormalization, and top-hat operation with a rectangular structuring element, followed by Moments threshold to segment \"innervation objects\". The objects are then measured using regionprops, as well as features of the background. We apply several simple thresholds for objects, such as a circularity less than 0.5 (large perimeter, small area) and aspect ratio greater than 2 (elongated). Finally, we use dimensionality reduction (PCA, UMAP) and clustering (K-Means) to identify 'types' of segmented objects, under the assumption that some objects are not true neuron axons and can be filtered out by identifying their subcluster. We save each cluster's segmentations for subsequent downstream analysis. "
